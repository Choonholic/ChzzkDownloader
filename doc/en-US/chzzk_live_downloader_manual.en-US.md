### Example
```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader -i 2 --thumb save --detect 30 --work work --out out --temp temp
```

## Initial Setup
For initial setup, the following items should be prepared.

* Streamer Channel UID

Execute without parameters for the first use.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader
```

For recommended initial setings, see [Recommended Initial Settings](#recommended-initial-settings) section in later.

## Downloading Multiple Channels Simultaneously
To download multiple channels at the same time, you can open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell console and run Chzzk Live Downloader. However, if you run without parameters, Chzzk Live Downloader will always download the first UID you registered, so if you want to specify a new UID, you can specify a new configuration with the following commands.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader -i n
ChzzkLiveDownloader --id n
```

The specific UID will be used again when you set the same parameters the next time, and automatically search for and download live streams with the UID.

## Setting or Resetting UID of a Specific ID

### Setting UID
To set the UID assigned to a specific ID, use the following commands.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader -i n -u uid or url
ChzzkLiveDownloader --id n --uid uid or url
```

If you want to change the UID assigned to the default ID, you can do so by specifying `0` for the `-i` (or `--id`) parameter, or by specifying only the `-u` (or `--uid`) parameter, as follows:

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader -u uid or url
ChzzkLiveDownloader --uid uid or url
```

### Resetting UID
To reset the UID assigned to a specific ID, use the following commands. This will work even if you have not previously assigned a UID to the ID.

For default ID:

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader -u
ChzzkLiveDownloader --uid
```

For a specific ID:

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader -i n -u
ChzzkLiveDownloader --id n --uid
```

## Downloading A Live Stream Only Once Without Saving Information
If you want to download a live stream with URL only once, rather than specifying and saving the streamer information, use the following command.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --once uid or url
```

## Resetting Authorized Credential
To download a live stream that requires NAVER authorized credential, such as an adult-only live stream, you must specify the following information.

* NAVER ID Authorization Key from Chzzk cookie (`NID_AUT`)
* NAVER ID Session Key from Chzzk cookie (`NID_SES`)

When the authorized credential is not found when downloading a clip that requires it, a prompt to enter your authorization will be activated.

If you enter these values, they will be set as defaults, and subsequent runs will use them without further input. For more information on how to get Chzzk authorized credential, please refer to `how_to_get_chzzk_credential.en-US.pdf`.

If your authorized credential has been changed, or if you need to reset them by logging in with a different ID, use the following commands.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader -a
ChzzkLiveDownloader --auth
```

With `-y` or `--yes` parameters, a prompt to enter the authorization will be activated automatically without any confirmation.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader -y
ChzzkLiveDownloader --yes
```

## Specifying Target Quality to Download
By default, all streams will be downloaded in the best quality possible. However, if you want to save them in a different quality for saving storage or other reasons, use the following commands. Also, if the stream is not using a standard resolution, the download will automatically choose the quality closest to the resolution you specify.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader -q 720p
ChzzkLiveDownloader --quality 720p
```

If you want to set this option to default, just use `-q` or `--quality` like below.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader -q
ChzzkLiveDownloader --quality
```

## Setting Output Filename Format
By default, the filename of videos and thumbnails to be saved will be `[{download_date}][{name}] {title}`. If you want to change this format, use the following command.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --name "[{name}][{category}] {title}"
```

If you want to set this option to default, just use `--name` without format like below.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --name
```

### Filename Format Tags
The following pre-defined tags can be used for filename format.

* `{name}` - Channel Name.
* `{verified}` - If channel is verified one, this tag will be `[âœ“]` or empty.

* `{..._date_second}` - Second as a zero-padded decimal number. (`00`, `01`, ..., `59`)

## Setting Live Stream Detection Interval
By default, the detection interval for live streams is set to 60 seconds. To change this, use the following command: `n` can be any value from `1` to `600`. Therefore, the detection interval can be set in seconds, from 1 second to 10 minutes.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --detect n
```

If you want to set this option to default, just use `--detect` like below.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --detect
```

## Handling Thumbnail Images
To save thumbnail images separately, use the following command.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --thumb save
```

To turn off this feature, use the following command.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --thumb skip
```

## Set How to Display Download Details
By default, fluent download details will be displayed. However, if you don't need the details, you can use the following command to prevent them from being displayed.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader -d quiet
ChzzkLiveDownloader --display quiet
```

The following display methods can be set with options of `--display` parameter.

* `quiet` - Suppress all download details.
* `fluent` - Show all fluent download details.
* `default` - This option is the same as `fluent`.

If you want to set this option to default, just use `-d` or `--display` like below.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader -d
ChzzkLiveDownloader --display
```

## Finalization
By default, Chzzk Live Downloader downloads in MPEGTS format with a `.ts` extension during the live download stage and converts it to MPEG4 format with a `.mp4` extension in the finalization stage when the download is complete. However, the finalization methods can be set with `--final` option like below.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --final all
```

The following finalization methods can be set with options of `--final` parameter.

* `none` - Just downloads transport stream files (`.ts`) and bypass converting stage. The transport stream files must be converted with the external converters for playing properly.
* `convert` - Converts transport stream files (`.ts`) to video files (`.mp4`), but don't remove transport stream files.
* `cleanup` - Converts transport stream files (`.ts`) to video files (`.mp4`), and clean up transport stream files.
* `cconvert` - Converts transport stream files (`.ts`) to video files (`.mp4`) with custom options by `--custom`, but don't remove transport stream files.
* `ccleanup` - Converts transport stream files (`.ts`) to video files (`.mp4`) with custom options by `--custom`, and clean up transport stream files.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --final convert
```

If you want to set this option to default, just use `--final` like below.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --final
```

### Custom Encoding During Finalization
You can set custom encoding options during finalization using the `--final` option with either `cconvert` or `ccleanup`. For example, the following options enable `FFmpeg` to encode using the `H.265` codec:

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --final cconvert --custom "-c:v libx265 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k"
```

Please note that custom encoding is not recommended due to its suboptimal performance. For better results, consider using external professional encoders.

## Set Start Offset
You can use the following command to set amount of time to skip from the beginning of the stream.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --offset 30
```

By default, the unit of time is seconds. However, you can also set through hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds as follows.


```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --offset 1:23:45.67
ChzzkLiveDownloader --offset 1h30m45.67s
```

## Set Duration and Split Downloading
You can use the following command to set the stream duration to download. If the `--once` parameter is not specified, the downloaded stream will be split into the specified duration.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --duration 3600
```

By default, the unit of time is seconds. However, you can also set through hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds as follows.


```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --duration 1:23:45.67
ChzzkLiveDownloader --duration 1h30m45.67s
```

## Set Stream Retrieving Method
By default, ChzzkLiveDownloader retrieves stream information from the Chzzk Time Machine API to download the stream at the earliest possible time. However, you can set stream retrieving method based of your preferences with the following command.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --stream standard
```

The following stream methods can be set with options of `--stream` parameter.

* `standard` - Retrieves stream information from the Chzzk default API.
* `timemachine` - Retrieves stream information from the Chzzk Time Machine API.

If you want to set this option to default, just use `--stream` like below.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --stream
```

## Set Working Directory
You can use the following command to specify the directory where required files are stored to work properly.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --work work
```

If you want to set this option to default, just use `--work` without directory like below.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --work
```

## Set Output Directory
You can use the following command to specify the directory where downloaded files are finally saved.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --out out
```

By default, all files are categorized and saved in subdirectories by streamer. If you want to save files without categorizing them by streamer, use the following command.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --category none
```

If you want to set this option to default, just use `--out` and `--category` without options like below.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --out --category
```

## Set Temporary Directory
You can use the following command to specify the temporary directory where the files being downloaded are saved.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --temp temp
```

If you want to set this option to default, just use `--temp` without directory like below.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --temp
```

## Directory Specification
You can specify directories in several ways as follows.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --temp temp
```

Specifies the `temp` directory under the current directory where the executable is located as the temporary directory. If the directory does not exist, it will be created.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --work \Users\Username\Documents\chzzk_work
```

Specifies the `\Users\Username\Documents\chzzk_work` directory on the current drive as the working directory. If the directory does not exist, it will be created.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --work C:\Users\Username\Documents\chzzk_work
```

Of course, you can specify the drive (e.g. `C:`) directly as shown above.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --out \\192.168.0.1\chzzk\out
```

Specifies the `\\192.168.0.1\chzzk\out` directory on a network storage based on a UNC path as the output directory. If the directory does not exist, it will be created.

When saving files to network storage, you may need to enter a username and password to connect to the network storage. This information can be specified as follows.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --work-user username --work-pass password
ChzzkLiveDownloader --out-user username --out-pass password
ChzzkLiveDownloader --temp-user username --temp-pass password
```

## Set how to save when the target file already exists
By default, when a file with the same name already exists, the file is saved with `(n)` appended to its name. However, you can use the following command to overwrite the file or skip download itself instead.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --exist overwrite
ChzzkLiveDownloader --exist skip
```

If you want to set this option to default, just use `--exist` without like below.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --exist
```

## Set the threshold % for stopping downloads when disk space is low
By default, downloading will stop if the free space in the storage directory or temporary directory drops below 10%. To set the free disk space threshold, use the following command. The acceptable range is `3` to `30`.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --threshold 20
```

To disable the feature that stops downloads based on free disk space, use the following command.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --threshold -
```

If you want to set this option to default, just use `--threshold` without like below.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --threshold
```

## Set Action When Saving Settings
All options are always saved to configuration files by default. If you want to apply settings to current session only without saving, use the following command.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --settings skip
```

However, the following information is always saved.

* All settings of saved streamer channel UIDs
* All settings of per-streamer target quality to download
* NAVER ID Authorization key from Chzzk cookie (`NID_AUT`)
* NAVER ID Session key from Chzzk cookie (`NID_SES`)

If you want to save the settings without downloading and exit, use the following command.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --settings quit
```

## Resetting All Configurations
Over time, you may find that you've mixed things up and want to reset your settings. To reset all configurations, use the following command.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --reset
```

This will reset the following information.

* All settings of saved streamer channel UIDs
* All settings of per-streamer target quality to download
* NAVER ID Authorization key from Chzzk cookie (`NID_AUT`)
* NAVER ID Session key from Chzzk cookie (`NID_SES`)
* Settings for live stream detection interval
* Settings for Saving thumbnail image
* Settings for displaying download details
* Settings for the finalization
* Settings for output and temporary directories

## Display Version Information
You can check the version information by using the following command.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --version
```

## Getting help
You can use the following command to get simple parameter help.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader -h
ChzzkLiveDownloader --help
```

## Parameter precedence
Except `--reset`, `-h` and `--version`, the parameters can be used in any order as shown below. However, multiple copies of the same parameter cannot be assigned.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader -i 1 -u --detect 30 --bypass -s
```

The `-h` and `--version` parameters are processed only with the first one used, and then terminated immediately afterward. Therefore, the following command will output only the version information.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --version -h
```

The `--reset` parameter resets the settings, ignoring any previously set values, then exits. Therefore, the `--detect` parameter will be ignored in the following command.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --detect 30 --reset
```

## Recommended Initial Settings
The following settings are recommeneded for the first use. The following command will set working directory (`--work`), output directory (`--out`), temporary directory (`--temp`) at once to making it easy to organize the downloaded video files.

```powershell
ChzzkLiveDownloader --work work --out out --temp temp
```
